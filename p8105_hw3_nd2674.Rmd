This is my solution to Homework 3.

Library imports

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(ggplot2)
```



# Section 1

Here's a **code chunk** that samples from 
a _normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

# Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.
